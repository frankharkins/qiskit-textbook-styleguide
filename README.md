# Qiskit Textbook Styleguide

This repository contains a style guide for writing in the Qiskit Textbook. It also includes a [Vale-compatible](https://github.com/errata-ai/vale) implementation of these guidelines. This repository is forked from [Errata-ai/write-good](https://github.com/errata-ai/write-good), modified to fit the tone of the textbook and to be more specific to quantum computing.
