# Qiskit Textbook Styleguide

This repository contains a style guide for writing in the Qiskit Textbook. It also includes a [Vale-compatible](https://github.com/errata-ai/vale) implementation of these guidelines. This repository is based on the [Errata-ai/write-good](https://github.com/errata-ai/write-good) template, modified to fit the tone of the Qiskit Textbook and to be more specific to quantum computing.

All files based on the [Vale implementation of write-good's rules](https://github.com/errata-ai/write-good) (MIT License), except:
